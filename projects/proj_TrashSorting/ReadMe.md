# Research Motivation

(based on facts that you collected from all sources possible)

- No publich accessible big data set of trash sorting
- Under-explored in robot learning with trash sorting (not really)
- Needs a baseline of system integration with robot picking station

# Research Question

- **What/How/Why** is **something that you are very interested** for **some target** happen or interact in **some scenarion**?
  - robotic manipulators for automated trash sorting
  - robot learning from a big dataset of trash sorting
  - challenges in system integration

- How can we learn from public trash datasets to design a robotic manipulation system for automated trash sorting?
  -  Can we learn from public trash datasets
  -  How to design a robotic manipulation system
  -  To what extent, can we generalize for automated trash sorting
