# Robot Library

The DeepClaw cell, shown on the bottom of the following figure, is a self-contained robot cell for manipulation tasks, including an assembled station, a robot arm, a robot end-effector, a visual sensor. Thanks to the standardized design, we are able to buy the components and assemble the robot station quickly. The hardware setup is defined in the software part of DeepClaw through configuration files. The same task should be easily reproduced on different hardware setups if the configuration file is adequately defined.
