## SSD
Single shot multibox detector (SSD) is a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. It combines segmentation and recognition functions, and the result of it is objects' bounding boxes and labels. The original introduction of this algorithm is in this [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325), and the implement we used is [here](https://github.com/balancap/SSD-Tensorflow/tree/fix_training)
